# 📰 NewsFlash

**NewsFlash** is a modern, single-page newsfeed application built with **React** and **Bootstrap**.  
It fetches live news from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=apple&from=2025-09-02&to=2025-09-02&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=6fea80e79c9c4e8a99098086cf432f42) and displays them in a clean, responsive card layout.  
Think of it as your **daily headlines hub**, styled with Bootstrap components and powered by React hooks. ⚡
