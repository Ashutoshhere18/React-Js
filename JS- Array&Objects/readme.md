# 🔁 JavaScript Array & Object Methods – Revision

This mini project was created as part of my **JavaScript revision** while preparing for **React.js**. Since React heavily uses array/object operations (like `map`, `filter`, `spread`, etc.), I practiced these core methods to strengthen my fundamentals.

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 📚 Array Methods
1. **Remove duplicates** from an array  
   `filter()` / `Set`

2. **Find sum** of all numbers in an array  
   `reduce()`

3. **Reverse** an array  
   `reverse()`

4. **Find max & min** in an array  
   `Math.max()`, `Math.min()` with spread

5. **Convert strings to uppercase**  
   `map()`, `toUpperCase()`

---

### 🧱 Object Methods
6. **Access object values**  
   Dot & Bracket notation

7. **Count number of properties**  
   `Object.keys().length`

8. **Convert object to array of key-value pairs**  
   `Object.entries()`

9. **Merge two objects**  
   Spread operator (`{ ...a, ...b }`), `Object.assign()`

## 🚀 Why This is Useful for React

In React:
- We **map over arrays** to render components dynamically.
- We manage **state as objects** and update them using the **spread operator**.
- We often work with **arrays of data** from APIs, requiring transformations.

Understanding these operations is **essential** for clean, efficient, and readable React code.

## 📌 Final Note

This practice helped me build stronger logic and fluency with JavaScript syntax. I recommend this kind of revision before diving deep into React or any front-end framework.
